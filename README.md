Welcome to the gochenour CLI!

This handy application offers a small collection of tools for automating the creation of unit tests, sorting CSS files, creating the files & folders for a new microservice, etc. There's quite a few features at this point. For a full list of them, run `npx gochenour --help` (or `npx goch -h` for short).

And while you're here, be sure to drool over the breathtakingly clean code and 99% test coverage--I wrote this using TDD with Vitest, the latest and greatest alternative to Jest.
