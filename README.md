Welcome to the gochenour CLI!

This handy application offers a small collection of tools for automating the creation of unit tests. It can be run directly (npx gochenour <flag>) or installed and symlinked.

For a full list of features, run `npx gochenour --help` (or `npx goch -h` for short).

And while you're here, be sure to drool over the breathtakingly clean code and 100% test coverage--I wrote this using TDD with Vitest, the latest and greatest alternative to Jest.
